This plugin allows you to access your chests remotely via command or linking.

Chest linking:
To link a chest block to a remote chest, place a sign above it with [rc] NAME on it.
It will automatically search for an existing remote chest with that name and link to that.
If the target chest does not exist, it will be created. 
Any items in the original chest block will be transferred to the remote chest. (When linking and when creating)
If there are so many items in the chest block that they do not fit into the remote chest, they will be dropped.

Commands, [arg] = Optional argument:
/rchelp                       - Show commands in-game
/rcopen <name>                - Open aremote chest
