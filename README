This plugin allows you to access your chests remotely via command or linking.

Chest linking:
To link a chest block to a remote chest, place a sign above it with [rc] NAME on it.
It will automatically search for an existing remote chest with that name and link to that.
If the target chest does not exist, it will be created.
Any items in the original chest block will be transferred to the remote chest. (When linking and when creating)
If there are so many items in the chest block that they do not fit into the remote chest, they will be dropped.

Possible settings:
signlocation:up - The location relative to the chest that the sign needs to be (up/down/north/east/south/west)
tagplayer:[player] - The tag that will be replaced by the player's name
maxchestsperplayer:10 - The maximum amount of chests a player can own
chestcreateprice:0 - The iConomy cost for creating a chest
chestlinkprice:0 - The iConomy cost for linking to a chest (using a sign)
